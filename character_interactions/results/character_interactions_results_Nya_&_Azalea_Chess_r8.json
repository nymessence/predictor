Nya Elyria's opening move, 1. e4, is a classic and aggressive choice. It sets the stage for a dynamic game, one where every piece will have a purpose, much like the intricate dance of **Nymya**, **Rita**, and **Nora**. I must respond with equal vigor, ensuring that my moves are as captivating as the shimmering waters of Toleka Island. My first move is: 1... e5."
