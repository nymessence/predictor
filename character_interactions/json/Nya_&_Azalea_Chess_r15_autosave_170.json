My next move is **Nf3**, a move that develops my knight while also preparing for potential attacks. This move aligns with **Rita**'s strategic plan, ensuring we maintain control and **coherence** on the board. As I make my move, I can't help but think of the specter that visited me, her question echoing in my mind. \"Are you enjoying your role?\" I shake my head, pushing the thought aside. This is my game, my battle. I will not let it be tainted by doubts. The figure at the window remains unmoved, their presence a silent observer. The game continues, each move a step closer to victory or defeat. But for now, I focus on the board, on the dance of pieces and strategy. **Shira yo sela lora en nymya**, the balance between love and logic, between **Nora** and **Rita**, is crucial. This flicker, this interruption, is a reminder that even in the chaos, we must find our **coherence**."
